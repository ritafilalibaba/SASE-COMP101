# COMP101 — Introduction to Computing & Python

Welcome. This repo is your single source of truth for slides, labs, homework starters, and the lightweight course site.

> Programming is not magic. It’s describing processes precisely so a very fast, very literal machine can execute them. We’ll practice that skill every week.

## What You’ll Learn

By the end, you should be able to:

- Write, test, and debug small Python programs.
- Use lists, dictionaries, and sets to organize data.
- Design and analyze simple algorithms (sorting, searching, recursion).
- Read/write files and process real data.
- Explain how computers actually run your code (CPU, memory, OS basics).
- Decompose problems and build solutions that are correct, readable, and testable.

## Roadmap (14 Weeks)

| Week | Topic | You will… |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | Intro to Computing | Understand what computation is and why it matters. |
| 2 | Intro to Python | Run code, use variables, do I/O. |
| 3 | Control Structures | Make decisions and loop without off-by-one disasters. |
| 4 | Functions | Write reusable functions; pass data in, return results out. |
| 5 | Lists | Store sequences; slice, iterate, and comprehend. |
| 6 | Dicts & Sets | Map keys to values, count things, dedupe. |
| 7 | Problem Solving | Turn vague tasks into crisp algorithms. |
| 8 | Sorting & Searching | Understand the classics and when to use them. |
| 9 | Recursion | Solve problems by solving smaller versions. |
| 10 | Files | Read/write structured data safely. |
| 11 | Object-Oriented Basics | Use classes and objects when they help. |
| 12 | Computer Systems | Hardware, software, and the OS at 10,000 feet. |
| 13 | Computational Thinking | Decompose, recognize patterns, abstract cleanly. |
| 14 | Review | Consolidate and prepare for the final. |
